Sierpinski Triangle generation by Monte Carlo method. The three corners A,B,C and a random point P 
is defined. The distance between P and a random selected point A,B or C is halved and P is set equal 
to the new point and P i plotted.

The program print the generated coordinates to standard output whuch can be directed to a file and plotted 
by e.g Gnuplot
